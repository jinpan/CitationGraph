# Citation Graph

This project is to create a graph of all the academic papers with papers as nodes and edges as vertices. This will serve as dependency graph of sorts to allow for queries not avaiable elsewhere.

For instance, one can search for the common dependencies between a group of papers to determine the foundational papers in the field. Additionally, one can search for extensions between a few papers to search for whether an idea has been pursued already.
